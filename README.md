The project provides an engaging educational experience to young students to learn about different exoplanets. It works using a web technology of ThreeJs and simulates a spaceship as well as the star system and planets. 

The website can be run on comparatively less computer resources, allowing undeserved sections of society with the access to the internet to be able to access our website and learn about exoplanets in an engaging and interesting way. It provides a new learning experience to children allowing them to imagine and understand the exoplanets. 

The team hopes to enable every young student using the website to feel like a scientist and explorer, evaluate, imagine, solve, enquire and be amazed by the wonders of space and astronomy. Every young student in the world from any region, language, or ethnicity  uses the website and becomes inspired.

The project used ThreeJS and HTML CSS with React and Vite for frontend to render the space scene, spaceship, orbiting planet in star system and exoplanets.

The project additionally uses AI Gemini to chat and enquire about exoplanets and AI Akool generated voice-over image of character which is the virtual user companion.

Information from research papers such as that of J. Spake et al about exoplanets was referred to and websites such as Wikipedia and NASA website were used for information.
